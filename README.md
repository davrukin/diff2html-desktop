# diff2html-desktop
GUI Application for diff2html CLI

I made this desktop app using TornadoFX in IntelliJ to create side-by-side diffs between two commits, allowing custom exceptions for Android and iOS. 

The resources I used:

https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html
https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html-cli
https://diff2html.xyz/
https://www.npmjs.com/package/diff2html-cli

Either run in IntelliJ or build a jar
